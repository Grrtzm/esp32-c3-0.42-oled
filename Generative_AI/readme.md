# Use of Generative AI (ChatGPT etc)

In this folder, you will find a prompt (in [Dutch](prompt_NL.txt) as well as in [English](prompt_EN.txt) that describes what the ESP32-C3 with the OLED screen can do and what its limitations are. Open your favorite AI tool; [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) or [one from duck.ai](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=DuckDuckGo+AI+Chat&ia=chat&duckai=1&atb=v369-1). Start a new conversation and paste the contents of the text file —the prompt— into the conversation. Start with this every time you start a new conversation. Your AI will then know the capabilities and limitations of your projects.

Here are some tips on how to effectively use ChatGPT or another generative AI for this purpose:

### 1. Clear and Specific Prompts

-   **Start simple**: Use simple language and avoid jargon. For example: "Explain what an ESP32-C3 is and what it is used for."
-   **Step-by-step instructions**: Ask for step-by-step explanations. For example: "Provide a step-by-step guide for installing MicroPython on an ESP32-C3."

### 2. Use of Examples

-   **Example code**: This repository contains various examples of working code. Copy and paste the code you want to use and modify it in the conversation. Say: "Use this code as a basis to create a new program." or "modify this program to..."
-   **Request example code**: Ask for example code that you can use and modify. For example: "Write a simple MicroPython program that blinks an LED on an ESP32-C3."
-   **Practical applications**: Ask for examples of practical applications. For example: "Provide an example of a project that uses a temperature sensor with an ESP32-C3 and MicroPython."

### 3. Interaction and Feedback

-   **Q&A sessions**: Use AI to answer questions. For example: "What does this error message in my MicroPython code mean?"
    -   **Tip**: Copy and paste the output and error code from your program into the conversation.
-   **Feedback on code**: Let AI provide feedback on your code. For example: "Check this MicroPython code for errors and suggest improvements."

### 4. Learning Resources and Sources

-   **Recommendations for sources**: Ask for recommendations for books, websites, and tutorials. For example: "What are good resources for beginners to learn MicroPython?"
-   **Summaries and explanations**: Let AI summarize complex concepts. For example: "Briefly explain what an interrupt is and how it works in embedded systems."
